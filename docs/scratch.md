Program actions

* save each file with `_encrypted.pdf` suffix added to original name

* before deleting original, program should error check - try to read and decrypt the file to ensure that it's encrypted right

on the flip side...

we also write a pdf decryption program

write a program that finds all encrypted pdfs in a folder and subfolders...

which creates a decrypted copy of pdf using a provided password

if password is wrong, program should print message to user and move onto the next pdf
